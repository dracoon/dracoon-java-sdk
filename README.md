# Dracoon Java SDK

A library to access the Dracoon REST API.

## Setup

#### Minimum Requirements

Java 8 or newer

#### Download

##### Maven

Add this dependency to your pom.xml:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.dracoon</groupId>
    <artifactId>dracoon-sdk</artifactId>
    <version>2.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```

##### Gradle

Add this dependency to your build.gradle:
```groovy
compile 'com.dracoon:dracoon-sdk:2.3.0'
```

##### JAR import

The latest JAR can be found [here](https://github.com/dracoon/dracoon-java-sdk/releases).

Note that you also need to include the following dependencies:
1. Bouncy Castle Provider: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.bouncycastle/bcprov-jdk15on
2. Bouncy Castle PKIX/CMS/...: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.bouncycastle/bcpkix-jdk15on
3. Dracoon Crypto SDK: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.dracoon/dracoon-crypto-sdk
4. Google Gson: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.code.gson/gson
5. Square OkHttp: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.squareup.okhttp3/okhttp
6. Square OkIo: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.squareup.okio/okio
7. Square Retrofit: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.squareup.retrofit2/retrofit
8. Square Retrofit Gson Converter: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.squareup.retrofit2/converter-gson

#### Java JCE Setup

**IMPORTANT FOR JAVA VERSION 8 (<162):**

You need to install the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy
Files. Otherwise you'll get an exception about key length or an exception when parsing PKCS private
keys.

The Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files can be found here:
- Java 8: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html

For Java 9 and above, the Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files are no longer needed.
(For more information see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1179672)

#### Usage on Android

The Android platform ships with a cut-down version of Bouncy Castle. In the past (pre-Android 3.0),
this caused conflicts and there was a separate version of the SDK for Android which used Spongy
Castle.

Because there are very few people who use pre-Android 3.0 devices, and the fact that Spongy Castle
is not maintained anymore, there is no longer a separate version.

To avoid problems you should reinitialize the Bouncy Castle security provider when your application
starts. This can be done by extending `Application` and using a static initialization block. See
following example.

```java
...

import org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider;

public class DracoonApplication extends Application {
    
    static {
        Security.removeProvider(BouncyCastleProvider.PROVIDER_NAME);
        Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());
    }

    ...
    
}
```

## Example

The following example shows how to get all root rooms.

```java
DracoonAuth auth = new DracoonAuth("access-token");

DracoonClient client = new DracoonClient.Builder(new URL("https://dracoon.team"))
        .auth(auth)
        .build();

long parentNodeId = 0L;

NodeList nodeList = client.nodes().getNodes(parentNodeId);
for (Node node : nodeList.getItems()) {
    System.out.println(node.getId() + ": " + node.getParentPath() + node.getName());
}
```

## Documentation

The documentation of the Dracoon SDK can be found [here](doc/main.md).
